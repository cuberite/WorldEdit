-- Implements the cPlayerState object, representing the full information that is remembered per player
-- Also implements the GetPlayerState() function for retrieving / initializing the player state





--- The dict-table of player states.
--[[
Each player has an entry in this dictionary, indexed by the player's Key.
The player name has been chosen as the Key, this means that multiple players of the same name
share their state and the state is global for all worlds.
Each entry is a cPlayerState class instance
